# Overview

This is my first mobile app and also my first time using the Kotlin language. It is a basic Flashcard app. You can create new flashcards and you can select a flashcard and practice learning the information by tapping it to flip it over.

This project was made to help me familiarize myself with a new programming language as well as learn how to create mobile apps.
